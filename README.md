- Removes each note's first line. 
- Converts links from standard Markdown style to Obsidian style (one link per line).
- Converts several Markdown formattings to Obsidian style:
    - Replaces Setext-style headers with Atx-style headers.
    - Converts horizontal rulers.
    - Converts highlighting.
    - Converts checkboxes.
    - Converts tags.

## Requirements

- A Python installation (version 3.6 or newer).

## Download

Save the file [zim2obsidian.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peter88213/markdown2md/main/src/zim2obsidian.py).

## Usage

1. If you use indentiation in your *Zim* notebook, consider running the **subst_indent.py** tool first. 
2. Have *Zim* export the notebook to Markdown (export each page to a separate file). 
3. Make sure the Markdown files have the ".md" extension. If not, run the **markdown2md.py** tool first.
4. If you have substituted indentiation with the **subst_indent.py** preprocessor, run the **indent_md.py** tool now.
5. Copy **zim2obsidian.py** into the export root directory. 
6. Start it by double clicking on it or from the console.
