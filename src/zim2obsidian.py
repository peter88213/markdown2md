"""Convert Zim Markdown export to Obsidian.

- Loops through all subdirectories of a Zim notebook Markdown export.
- Removes each note's first level heading and renames the file accordingly. 
- Replaces Setext-style headers with Atx-style headers.
- Converts horizontal rulers.
- Converts internal links to other pages to Obsidian style.

Usage:

1. Have Zim export the Notebook to Markdown (Export each page to a separate file). 
2. Make sure the Markdown files have the ".md" extension. If not, run markdown2md.py first.
3. Copy this Python script into the export root directory. 
4. Start it by double clicking on it or from the console. 

Requires Python 3.6+
