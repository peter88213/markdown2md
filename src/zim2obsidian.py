"""Post-process Zim Markdown export for use with Obsidian.

- Loops through all subdirectories of a Zim notebook Markdown export.
- Optionally renames pages according to the names given by the top first level heading.
- Optionally removes each note's first line. 
- Optionally replaces Setext-style headers with Atx-style headers and converts horizontal rulers.
- Optionally converts internal links to other pages to Obsidian style.

Usage:

1. Have Zim export the Notebook to Markdown (Export each page to a separate file). 
2. Make sure the Markdown files have the ".md" extension. If not, run markdown2md.py first.
3. Copy this Python script into the export root directory. 
4. Start it by double clicking on it or from the console. 

Requires Python 3.6+
